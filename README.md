# CI-Catalogue
Created by EMAngel2718.
The CI Catalogue is a homebrew content pack created to be added to Lancer, the tabletop RPG by Massif Press, via https://compcon.app.
The latest version of the lcp will be contained in the main folder and be named "CI Catalogue.lcp".
Please direct any interested persons to this git so that I can keep track of interest.
I hope you enjoy!
